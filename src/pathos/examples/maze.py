"""
2D Grid / Maze Search Domain for Pathos AI.

This module defines a classic grid-based navigation problem, suitable for:
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Uniform-Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search (with a heuristic)

It demonstrates:
- A Goal-Oriented problem
- A Cost-Sensitive problem
- A clean separation between domain logic and search algorithms
